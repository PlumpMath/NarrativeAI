Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.98,0:00:03.88,Default,,0,0,0,,So, I'm gonna give a series of 4 lectures
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.14,0:00:08.80,Default,,0,0,0,,on Proof Theory and its foundations
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.30,0:00:14.22,Default,,0,0,0,,And ... already set me up to some extent in terms of the first lecture.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.66,0:00:18.18,Default,,0,0,0,,you can think of this as being titled Judgements and propositions
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.24,0:00:22.36,Default,,0,0,0,,so I will draw the distinction, and talk about
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.36,0:00:24.36,Default,,0,0,0,,how we actually define a logic
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.36,0:00:25.98,Default,,0,0,0,,what is a logic, how do we define it
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.98,0:00:27.06,Default,,0,0,0,,how do we work with it
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.36,0:00:29.26,Default,,0,0,0,,and things like that
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.26,0:00:32.66,Default,,0,0,0,,and if you think about the trinity picture
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.66,0:00:34.40,Default,,0,0,0,,that Bob drew
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.42,0:00:38.28,Default,,0,0,0,,so, we had a Proof Theory over here
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.78,0:00:44.74,Default,,0,0,0,,and Logic, and here we have Type Theory
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.42,0:00:55.56,Default,,0,0,0,,over here, and we had Category Theory over here
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.80,0:00:59.22,Default,,0,0,0,,we can also think of this slightly different point of view
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.22,0:01:02.86,Default,,0,0,0,,you can think of this as being mostly the domain of Philosophy
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.22,0:01:04.82,Default,,0,0,0,,if you will.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.98,0:01:09.52,Default,,0,0,0,,And of course we know how these things are connected.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.52,0:01:12.18,Default,,0,0,0,,and this is Computer Science
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.84,0:01:17.78,Default,,0,0,0,,and this is Maths
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.92,0:01:24.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and one of the reasons why we're doing this kind of thing
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.00,0:01:26.78,Default,,0,0,0,,together is to show that they're all aspects of
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.78,0:01:28.78,Default,,0,0,0,,the same thing that we're trying to do.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.54,0:01:32.66,Default,,0,0,0,,Today in the first lecture I'll stay mostly in this
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.66,0:01:35.36,Default,,0,0,0,,in this realm here, Philosophy, Logic and Proof Theory
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.36,0:01:39.72,Default,,0,0,0,,even though I'll make some brief connections to the other topics.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.44,0:01:42.82,Default,,0,0,0,,and then, in the second lecture
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.74,0:01:46.68,Default,,0,0,0,,I'll taks about Proofs as programs
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.70,0:01:55.54,Default,,0,0,0,,I reserve the right to adjust this lecture, as I see what Bob's actually doing
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.30,0:02:00.58,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm gonna try to move a bit into this direction
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.58,0:02:03.80,Default,,0,0,0,,ok, so away from this, into this direction
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.36,0:02:08.22,Default,,0,0,0,,in the third one I'll talk about Proof search
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.40,0:02:14.60,Default,,0,0,0,,this is a very important topic
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.60,0:02:18.92,Default,,0,0,0,,perhaps not so much because, I mean there is a connection, of course
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.92,0:02:20.92,Default,,0,0,0,,in this picture
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.92,0:02:24.60,Default,,0,0,0,,on this side, we can ??? Sequent Calculus
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.30,0:02:31.04,Default,,0,0,0,,but also, if you use a sistem like Coq
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.04,0:02:33.78,Default,,0,0,0,,then you're doing Theorem Proving
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.78,0:02:35.92,Default,,0,0,0,,and when you're doing Theorem Proving you need to understand
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.92,0:02:37.92,Default,,0,0,0,,how you search for proofs
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.92,0:02:39.96,Default,,0,0,0,,and so it's very important to talk about the
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.96,0:02:43.30,Default,,0,0,0,,basic principles of Proof search you can use this kind of things effectively
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.30,0:02:45.30,Default,,0,0,0,,so that's the third lecture
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.86,0:02:47.38,Default,,0,0,0,,and I'm kind of still edging my bets
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.38,0:02:49.38,Default,,0,0,0,,on the fourth lecture, to see
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.38,0:02:51.38,Default,,0,0,0,,exactly what I'm gonna do. What I did last year was
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.38,0:02:53.38,Default,,0,0,0,,called focusing, and I might do that again
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.38,0:02:56.34,Default,,0,0,0,,or I might brach out in some different direction, talk about
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.34,0:02:58.34,Default,,0,0,0,,some other topic, like Monads
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.34,0:03:00.34,Default,,0,0,0,,and things like that
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.06,0:03:03.84,Default,,0,0,0,,let's come to the first topic
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.84,0:03:05.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Judgements and propositions
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.72,0:03:15.52,Default,,0,0,0,,what I've already ??? the basic idea
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.52,0:03:19.90,Default,,0,0,0,,that we have when we make a judgement, something like "a is true"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.12,0:03:24.32,Default,,0,0,0,,and this thing here is a proposition
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.86,0:03:31.02,Default,,0,0,0,,and the thing taken as a whole, that's what we call a Judgement
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.40,0:03:38.06,Default,,0,0,0,,And Martin Lof would say that a judgement is an object of knowledge
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.06,0:03:40.06,Default,,0,0,0,,it is something that we actually know
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.06,0:03:42.76,Default,,0,0,0,,where a proposition is something in particular
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.76,0:03:44.76,Default,,0,0,0,,about which we make ??? different judgements
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.44,0:03:52.26,Default,,0,0,0,,and so we can think of other judgements to make about propositions, besides the fact that they're true
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.42,0:03:57.40,Default,,0,0,0,,so another judgement I want to make, for example is to say
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.20,0:04:00.64,Default,,0,0,0,,it is false
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.64,0:04:02.64,Default,,0,0,0,,that a typical judgement that we often make
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.64,0:04:04.64,Default,,0,0,0,,about a proposition
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.64,0:04:06.64,Default,,0,0,0,,another judgement you this morning
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.64,0:04:08.16,Default,,0,0,0,,which is 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.16,0:04:10.16,Default,,0,0,0,,? is a proof of a or
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.16,0:04:12.16,Default,,0,0,0,,equivalent to say that M is
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.16,0:04:14.16,Default,,0,0,0,,a program which has type A
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.10,0:04:17.72,Default,,0,0,0,,so we know that, by the connection between
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.72,0:04:21.08,Default,,0,0,0,,two pause on this triangle there
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.08,0:04:23.08,Default,,0,0,0,,that these are really the same thing
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.08,0:04:25.08,Default,,0,0,0,,it's another judgement
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.08,0:04:27.08,Default,,0,0,0,,
